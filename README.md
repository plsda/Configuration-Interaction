# Configuration-Interaction

Davidson's algorithm is a numerical algorithm for finding the lowest eigenvalue(s) of diagonally dominant (real symmetric) matrices. Davidson's algorithm
and its derivatives are widely used in configuration interaction calculations.

Example output:


Let A be a N by N matrix defined by
